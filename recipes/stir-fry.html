    <h2 style="margin-left: 11%;">Description</h2>


    <p style="font-size: larger; width: 90%; margin-left: 10px;">Chicken stir-fry is a vibrant and flavorful dish that
        combines tender pieces of chicken with a variety of crisp, colorful vegetables. The chicken is typically cut
        into bite-sized chunks and quickly cooked in a hot skillet or wok, ensuring it remains juicy and flavorful. The
        vegetables, often including bell peppers, broccoli, and snap peas, are sautéed until they are tender yet still
        crisp, adding a delightful crunch to the dish. Aromatic ingredients like garlic and ginger are often used to
        enhance the flavor, creating a rich and savory base.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger; width: 90%; margin-left: 10px;">Stir-fry is finished with a savory sauce made from soy
        sauce, rice vinegar, honey, and sesame oil, which is poured over the cooked chicken and vegetables. This sauce
        adds a glossy sheen and a burst of umami flavor that ties the dish together. Served over steamed rice or
        noodles, the chicken stir-fry is a balanced and satisfying meal that showcases the fresh flavors and textures of
        its ingredients.</p>

      <ol style="font-size: large; width: 90%; margin-left: 10px;">
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and cornstarch in a medium glass or ceramic bowl; stir until smooth. Stir in ginger, garlic, and red pepper flakes; add chicken and stir to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add broccoli, onion, carrots, water chestnuts, and bell pepper; cook and stir until just tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a dish; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon sesame oil in the same wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, reserving marinade, and cook until just browned, about 2 minutes per side; stir in vegetables and reserved marinade. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
